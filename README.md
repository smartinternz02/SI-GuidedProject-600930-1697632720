## Executive Summary

The Potato illness Classification project attempts to create a machine learning model that can correctly categorize various illness kinds according to their outward appearance. We are dedicated to developing machine learning and computer vision techniques, which includes this project. 

Project Objectives
- Use a dataset of photos of potato leaves to train a deep learning model.
- Classify potato diseases with great accuracy.
- Implement the model for practical uses in potato disease categorization.

Project Stages

### 1.The Idea Stage

During this first stage, we will be concentrating on ideation and learning about the project. Two crucial instruments will be employed by us:

#### Empathy Map Canvas: 
By using the Empathy Map Canvas, we can better understand the needs and viewpoints of our target audience and develop a user-centered solution for potato disease classification.

#### Brainstorming Map: 
We will be able to explore a wide range of ideas and techniques for the Potato Disease Classification Project by using the Brainstorming Map as a focal point for creative thinking.

### 2. Phase of Design
We will create a plan for our potato disease categorization system throughout the design phase. The following essential components are included in this phase:

#### Proposed Solution:
Including articulating the problem statement, idea, innovation, societal impact, business model, and scalability, we will define the whole solution for the categorization of potato diseases.

#### Technology Stack:
During this stage, the technical architecture, components, technologies, and application characteristics for the potato disease classification project will be defined.

#### Project Scheduling Information: 
The product backlog, sprint schedule, project tracker, velocity and burndown chart, board section, backlog section, and project timeline are just a few of the project planning tools that will be covered in this section.

### 4.Phase of Development
Building on the plan developed during the Planning Phase, we will actively implement the potato classification model in the Development Phase. The following essential components are included in this phase:



#### Development Phase
Within the Development Phase, we will actively progress with the implementation of the potato disease classification model, building upon the blueprint formulated during the Planning Phase. This phase encompasses the following crucial elements:

#### Dataset
This section showcases images of various potato diseases, such as blight, scab, rot, and other ailments. These images are fundamental to our project, serving for classification, analysis, and visualization purposes. They are categorized by disease type for convenient accessibility and utilization in development, testing, and related project activities.

#### Potato Disease Classification Jupyter Notebook
The Jupyter Notebook contains code and guidelines for the deep learning-based classification of potato diseases. It covers different disease categories using image data. The notebook incorporates code snippets, explanations, and visual aids to assist users in creating and training potato disease classification models.

#### Flask Source Code
Here, you will find the Flask source code for the "Potato Disease Classification Project." This code includes route definitions, view functions, HTML templates, and Flask configurations. It is indispensable for comprehending how Flask powers the project's web application.

#### Project Manual
A project manual is a comprehensive guide that outlines project objectives, methodologies, roles, and best practices. It serves as a navigation tool and collaborative resource, ensuring systematic and successful project execution.

### 5. Performance and Final Submission Phase

In the Performance and Final Submission Phases, we assess and refine the potato classification model developed in the previous phase. Our goal is to validate its performance and create a detailed report for the final submission.

#### Solution Performance
The Solution Performance is a document that includes a summary of the model and its accuracy, encompassing both training and validation results.

#### Project Documentation
This comprehensive set of records includes details regarding data collection, deep learning model development, evaluation metrics, code, user interfaces, and deployment procedures. It serves as a vital reference for project stakeholders, offering support for troubleshooting, future maintenance, and the transfer of knowledge.


Thank you for your hard work and dedication. Your commitment has brought us here, and success is on the horizon. Best of luck as we move forward!
