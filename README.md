 ## Overview 
 
  Classification of potato diseases aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify different  diseases based on their visual characteristics. This project is  part of our commitment to the development of computer vision and machine learning techniques. 
 
 ## Project objectives 
 - Train a deep learning model on a dataset of images of potato leaves. - To achieve a high accuracy of classification of potato diseases. - Use the model in real potato disease classification applications.  ## Project stages 
 
 ### PROJECT PHASES
### 1.Ideation Phase
 
 In this initial phase, we focus  on brainstorming and getting a vision for the project. We  use  two important tools: 
 
 #### Empathy Map Canvas: 
 The Empathy Map Canvas allows us to gain a deep understanding of the perspectives and requirements of our target users, which helps us create a user-centric potato disease classification solution. 
  #### Brain card: 
 The brainstorming map is a focus for creative thinking and allows us to explore many ideas and strategies within the potato disease classification project. 
 ### 2. Design phase 
 In the planning phase, we create a plan for our potato disease classification solution. This step includes the following critical elements: 
 
 #### Suggested solution: 
 We  define an end-to-end solution for potato disease classification, including  problem statement formulation, ideation, innovation, social impact, business model and scalability. 
  #### Solution architecture: 
 We are designing the technical architecture of our potato disease classification system. This includes decisions about infrastructure, such as cloud services or on-premises servers, as well as figuring out how different system components interact with the software. 
 #### Data flow diagram: 
 A data flow diagram describes how data is collected, processed, and fed into a machine learning model. It introduces data sources, data processing steps, and  model training and evaluation processes. 
  ### 3. Planning phase 
 In the planning phase, we  create a plan for our potato disease classification model. This step includes the following key components: 
 
 #### Technology stack: 
 In this step, we  define the technology stack for the potato disease classification project, which includes the technical architecture, components, technologies and application functions. 
 #### Project planning information: 
 This section focuses on  aspects of project planning, including  product order, sprint schedule, project tracking, velocity and exhaustion chart, whiteboard section, backlog section, and project schedule. 
### 4.Development phase 
 In the development phase, we  actively implement the potato classification model based on the plan developed in the planning phase. This step includes the following key elements: 
 
 #### Stage of development 
 In the development phase, we are actively promoting the implementation of the potato disease classification model based on the plan developed in the planning phase. This step includes the following important elements: 
 
 #### Database 
 This section contains images of various potato diseases such as blight, scab, rot and other diseases. These images are important to our project and will be used for classification, analysis and visualization. They are classified by disease type for easy access and use in development, testing and design activities. 
  #### Classification of Potato Diseases Jupyter Notebook 
 A Jupyter notebook contains code and instructions for potato disease classification based on deep learning. It covers different disease categories using image data. The notebook contains code snippets, explanations and visual aids to help users build and train potato disease classification models. 
 #### Flask source code 
 Here you can find the Flask source code  andquot;Potato Disease Classification Project.andquot; This code contains route definitions, view actions, HTML templates and piston settings. It is necessary to understand how Flask works with project and web application. 
  #### Project guide 
 A project manual is a comprehensive guide that outlines project goals, methods, roles and best practices. It acts as a navigation tool and collaboration resource, ensuring a systematic and successful project implementation. 
 ### 5. Performance and Final Delivery Stage 
 
 In the execution and final delivery phase, we evaluate and refine the potato classification model developed in the previous phase. Our goal is to confirm its performance and prepare a detailed report for  final submission. 
  #### Solution activity 
 The solution performance is a document that summarizes the model and its accuracy and includes both training and validation results. 

  #### Project documentation 
 This comprehensive set of records includes information on data collection, deep learning model development, evaluation metrics, code,  interfaces, and implementation procedures. It serves as an important benchmark for project stakeholders, providing support for troubleshooting, future maintenance and data transfer. 
 
 Thank you for your hard work and dedication. Your dedication has brought us here and success is visible. Good luck on your journey ahead!
