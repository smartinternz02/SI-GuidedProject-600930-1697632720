## Project Development Phase

Greetings from the Potato Classification Project's development phase. Building and implementing the potato categorization system in accordance with the planning parameters specified in the planning phase will be the main emphasis of this phase.

### Contents Table
    
### Project Manual

The Potato Disease Classification Project's fundamental document, the Project Manual, provides precise goals, methods, and best practices. It delineates roles and responsibilities, guaranteeing a methodical approach and cultivating a collective vision for the fruitful creation of a classification system for potato diseases.

The sections of the handbook are as follows:

Data Preparation for Potato Disease Classification: This section offers instructions on how to obtain the dataset and arrange photos of potato diseases, both of which are necessary for data preparation.
 
Preparing Data for Potato Disease Categorization


-Describes how to import and set up the ImageDataGenerator library to process data for training and testing datasets efficiently.

Building a Model to Classify Potato Diseases

Provides comprehensive guidelines on how to build, assemble, and train a pre-trained model specifically designed for the classification of potato diseases. The monitoring of validation loss and testing the model with customized inputs are also covered in this part.

Developing a Flask Application for Classifying Potato Diseases

- Describes the steps involved in building an HTML website and a Flask-based web application that will implement the potato disease classification model while guaranteeing accessibility and usefulness.
